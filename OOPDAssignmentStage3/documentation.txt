This document outlines the valid format of a music library file.

The music library is stored in a CSV file, where each row denotes   
    a new song in the library.
Each row contains information about a record,
    digital music file, or cassette.

Records are stored in the form:
    R,<Song Name>,<Artist Name>,<Song Duration>,<Track Number>,<Play Speed>

Digital music files are stored in the form:
    D,<Song Name>,<Artist Name>,<Song Duration>,<File Type>

Cassettes are stored in the form:
    C,<Song Name>,<Artist Name>,<Song Duration>,<Track Number>,
        <Start Time>,<Cassette Side>

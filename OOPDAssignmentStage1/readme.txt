Functionality:
    All user interface menus have been completed, and the user is informed
        if functionality is not yet implemented.
    Music library information can be read and validated from files,
        with descriptive information being provided to the user if
        the information is invalid.
    File output has been partially implemented, outputting a message
        to the file.

TODO: All functionality for stage 1 has been completed.

Known bugs
	There are no known bugs in this program.

Additional functionality:
    -Prompt the user if they want to overwrite a file,
        before overwriting.
    -Exit gracefully upon command line EOF.
